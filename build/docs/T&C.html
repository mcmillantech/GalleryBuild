<h2>Seller Obligations</h2>
<p>
When you sign up to sell with us, you automatically agree to these Terms and Conditions. 
We obviously recommend that you look at these BUT  we've shortened them here 
and they are in plain English! 
Here are the easy to digest Obligations.  Agreeing to these means we both keep
 our side of the bargain, work as a team and offer something really amazing 
 and unique to our customers. Having these Obligations is just part and parcel 
 of explaining the business side of things clearly.
</p>
Your Obligations:
<ul>
<li>Be committed to selling your work online</li>
<li>Stick to our standards in terms of quality of product and what you can sell. 
You can only sell your own artwork. We are a platform for the artists themselves.</li>
<li>Stick to our customer service standards such as answering customer queries,
 posting in good time.</li>
<li>Be keen to earn an income or part income from sales generated through our Marketplace</li>
<li>Stick to our pricing standard. Keep to the same prices across your public 
forums and outlets so as not to purposefully undercut your goods on this platform. 
We reserve the right to cease your trading if you are wilfully undercutting 
and using the platform solely to promote your products on other platforms or directly. </li>
<li>Follow the help guides provided to set up your Store and shipping; and 
to upload your Products. These are attached in emails set when you join. 
They will be available shortly on this website.
<li>Have a great profile image and compelling artist biography</li>
<li>Have 6  artworks  listed at any one time with high quality images and clear descriptions.</li>
<li>Only upload products which are available now.</li>
<li>Upload quality images with about1000 pixels on one side.  This enhances 
your work. Images are the most important thing when selling online. Your uploaded 
images will convert to a thumbnail and a main product image and will zoom 
automatically through the site's software</li>
<li>Be organised with sales, customer queries, sufficient packaging, good 
presentation, prompt deliveries and effective returns policy in line with ours</li>
<li>Include an NEW ART FOR YOU Certificate of Authenticity which will be 
available to print when you get an order. You cannot use your own branding 
and contact information. Any work sold on the website is subject to

online selling platforms such as Amazon</li>

group New Art for You Artists. Like the official Facebook Page "NewArtForYou", 
follow us on Twitter and Instagram.</li>

 to your shop from your own social media and your own websites</li>
<li>Inform us of your bank details when requested, so we can transfer your net earnings</li>
<li>Pay at source 20% commission to us on all your sales. This happens automatically</li>

the refund. Please refer to our Returns and Refunds Policy</li>

</ul>
<p>We recommend that you read the full Seller Terms and Conditions, our legal binding document</p>

<p>Seller Shipping and Delivery Policy
<p>The Shipping and Delivery Policy is part of our Terms and Conditions. One of 
the main aspects of online selling is shipping. Setting this up on your ART WALL
 is straightforward and you are provided with Guidelines. The customers want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much extra their purchases will to cost to ship or post (on top of the 
price of the product) before they purchase.</li>
<li>That the postage charge is in line with standard postal services.</li>

<li>That their item is well packaged so it won't arrive damaged.</li>
<li>That it is going to arrive in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The NEWARTFORYOU  product is bespoke, different and original, with particular 
inspiration and individual narrative. We recognise that shipping and delivery 
is not a uniform process for all situations. We tell our customers that the 
items come directly from studios, workshops, even kitchen tables, and that 
artists and makers are not machines in some kind of mass market factory. Neither 
are we selling from an Amazon store. We see this lack of uniformity as a strength, 
even down to the shipping and delivery of pieces.</p>

<p>However we do need to maintain general important principles to give a good 
level of customer service. The Shipping and Delivery Policy is part of the 
Seller Terms and Conditions and is an important part of the NEWARTFORYOU online brand.</p>

The Seller must:
<ul>
<li>
The Seller must ensure delivery includes signed proof of delivery. 48 hours from 
the Seller providing us with the Proof of Delivery, and on confirmation that 
he/she has not received any complaint or request for refund, the seller's fee 
will be transferred online to his or her nominated bank account.
</li>
<li>Dispatch artwork within 3 days if possible.</li>
<li>Pack items appropriately. For light unbreakable items layers of bubble 
wrap are good and light. Be prepared for Returns if your item was damaged in the post.</li>
<li>Set up shipping costs on the ART WALL so Customers see the full cost.</li>
<li>Charge reasonably for postage. You may be able to offer free postage for 
some items or a standard charge for everything depending on your product.</li>
our customer
<li>Use your Admin Dashboard to keep track of your order processing</li>
<li>If you are on Vacation, remember to list your artwork AWAY FOR THOSE DAYS 
in your Admin Dashboard temporarily. Just remember to change it back when you return.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Seller Returns and Refunds Policy</h3>
<p>Customers may not return a product unless the artwork has been damaged 
in transit. Painting and prints are delicate objects and cannot be handled 
multiple times without incurring serious damage.</p>

<p>If frames or glass are damaged in transit, the customer has the option, 
with photographic evidence, to request a 10% to 20% refund and retain the work. 
This allows for the artwork to be reframed at the customer's cost.</p>

<h3>Customer returns and claims for refunds on damaged artworks as received</h3>
<p>The Customer must contact you within 48 hours of receipt to inform you of damage 
to his order. He must send a photograph of the damage, and discuss the damage with you. if 
it is glass broken he can claim a 10% refund, or for frame damage, 20%.</p>
<p>If he wishes to return the goods, they must be returned within ten days 
of the report of the damage.</p>

<p>The Customer must package the item up in the original packaging to 
ensure no further damage. He must insure it for the amount minus the damage. 
He must send it back to you within 10 days of letting you know that he 
wants to return the product (we recommend he uses a signed-for delivery service 
with proof of postage). Please note that he will have to bear the direct cost of 
returning the product if he does not accept the damage discount.</p>

<p>We shall process the refund directly to the Customer's Paypal or bank account 
14 days after the day the product is received by you; or if earlier, 14 days 
after the date the Customer provides evidence that they have returned the product to you.</p>

<p>If the Customer is simply unhappy with the artwork, he/she should approach 
the artist (you) for a possible exchange. This may be done only at your discretion.</p>
<p>We advise the Customer not to destroy or throw away any packaging, as no full 
refund can be made unless the artwork is returned safely to the artist.</p> 
<p>The Customer is liable for any diminished value of the product resulting 
from the handling of the product in any way other than what is necessary to e
stablish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the product while he is 
responsible for it (this includes, in the context of a return, when the product 
is in transit back to you).</p>
<p>As a Seller you must comply with our Returns and Refunds Policy, as part of 
these Terms and Conditions. It is an essential part of customer service and 
gives peace of mind when ordering.</p>
