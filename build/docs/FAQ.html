<p class=MsoNormal><b>YOU ARE INVITED!<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you want an outlet for your art! Most artists are coping
with isolation by making more art, but without any way of getting money from
it. This revenue is critical for those self-employed and any income is welcome.
This is why my husband John McMillan and I are launching...<b>www.newartforyou.co.uk</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It already does on my website <b>www.lupecunha.co.u</b>k
which is a fully functioning shopping cart. Visit it and see! The only
difference is on this new website each 'Collection' will be a different artist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will restrict numbers to 30 artists for launching on 1st
June with work being uploaded and promoted from the 15th May. This offer will
be initially by invitation to artists whose work we know. Additional
availability will then extended to other artists. Cost is only £25.00 per entry
for six months and then 20% commission on sales. Dispatch will be undertaken by
the individual artists and on receipt of confirmation of receipt of work, funds
will be transferred to the artist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>STEP ONE<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are interested in becoming part of this project, to
encourage artists to put new work out there regularly (The only restriction is
that the art have been produced in the last six to 12 months), click on <b>JOIN
NEW ART</b> to send us your email contact details and three sample images of
your work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>FAQ<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-The £25 is only your artist setup fee and not per work.
This covers you for a six month period from 1 June 2020 to 1 December 2020. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-The work does not have to be exclusive to the site - if you
sell it elsewhere we do not charge any commission and you can replace your work
as often as you like in these 6 months as long as it is of the same standard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-You hold on to your work and dispatch it from where you
are. Postage and packing is billed extra and no commission on this. You set
your own postage and packing rates when you log in your work <span class=GramE>and</span>
you can change it whenever you like if you feel you got it wrong. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-We do need proof of receipt from the customer to release
your fee so please cost in signed delivery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-Regarding framing: If a work is Unframed then dispatch
rolled up is cheaper and easier. But some people prefer to buy framed work.
This however needs more careful packaging. If work is damaged in transit we
will refund purchase price but not postage. You can include both <span
class=GramE>and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>set</span> a different
packing rate for each. There is the facility for this in the software. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-Each artists will be shown the procedure of how to upload.
This will be trialed with a small group to ensure we have clear written
instructions and possibly small Zoom tutorial if required. It is very easy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-We have an account with a subsidiary of Paypal (same
security safeguards) which processes the money and pays in to my special
holding account. When we received signed confirmation of receipt of artwork we
process immediately with a 48 window for complaints. Refunds only available if
goods arrive damaged and returned at buyers cost. Postage and packing paid
regardless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-The commission paid is to cover us for all the admin work
involved including bank charges, credit charges and a limited social media paid
promotion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-I have set up a FB page to use for marketing and PR
purposes and as you sign on to the site and upload your photos and info we will
post it there and use it for advertising purposes. Everyone has to commit to
sharing on Social Media the link to their page which then links on to the site.
The more sharing we do the better it works for all. I will also be exploring
other marketing online technique with the <span class=GramE>advise</span> of a
digital marketing company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-when you sell an artwork online we will ask for your bank
details so as to make an online bank transfer directly to your account. I have
experience of transferring funds both in the UK and abroad and will let you
know closer what you will need to provide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-we will approach every stage with the same element of
security as we undertake for our own site. A certificate of Security for the
website has been applied for and will be clearly in place before we launch and
attempt to accept any money. Also the links to your sites and email will only
be done when this is activated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>STEP TWO<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-before making your payment, please <b>REGISTER ON NEW ART</b>
by completing our survey, so we have your permission to sell your work on this
site. This also indicates that you have read and accepted our terms of
business. Receipt of this survey, constitutes our contract with you, and we
will activate your login for purchase.</p>
