To Do

 Undefined index: artist in \www\GalleryBuild\build\admin\artgroup.php on line 39

Public home page - indexv needs the image from config / -
Lupe wants hover image to change
Allow upload of artist picture - to images, not small

Check options list - have I done them all - see options.xml

Topv.html option 5 reads "About Lupe"
Use imgpath for all paths in admin
Look into password encryption
